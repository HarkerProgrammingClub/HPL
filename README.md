# HPL

Welcome to HPL, Harker's Middle School Programming Club project.

# What is HPL for ?
Basically, HPL is a language that we are building to replace BASIC. After some research, we've found that the languages we learn in our Computer Science class are not as good as we'd like them to be. We hope HPL will override them with its awesomeness

# Guidelines
First, you must be an official member of the club to make important changes
If you are a Harker Student, you may fork this project and edit it as you'd like.

# Where we are
Right now, we are still developing the philosophy and syntax. Stay tuned for more updates and changes

# Why JavaScript
JavaScript is a language that can easily be implemented on the web. This means that we can make our code open source and develop online IDE's for it.
It is also very easy to learn and most of the members know it or can easily learn it.
This also means that anyone editing just needs to know some JavaScript.
