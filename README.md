# HPL

Welcome to HPL, Harker's Middle School Programming Club project.

# What is HPL for ?
Basically, HPL is a language that we are building to replace BASIC. After some research, we've found that the languages we learn in our Computer Science class are not as good as we'd like them to be. We hope HPL will override them with its awesomeness

# Guidelines
