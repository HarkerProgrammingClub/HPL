# HPL

Welcome to HPL, Harker's Middle School Programming Club project. "HPL" is a placeholder name.

# What is HPL for?
Quite BASICally, HPL is a language that we are building to partially replace and supplement BASIC in our Computer Science classes. After some research, we've found that the languages we learn in our Computer Science class are not as good as we'd like them to be. We hope HPL will partially replace them and perhaps supplement them with its awesomeness.

# Guidelines
First, you must be an official member of the club to make important changes. However, if you are a Harker student in any grade, you may fork this project and edit it as you'd like.

# Where we are
Right now, we are still developing the philosophy and syntax of this currently nameless language. Stay tuned for more updates and changes; they will be posted here as soon as possible. Thank you.

# Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is a language that can easily be implemented on the web. This means that we can make our code open source and develop online IDEs for it. It is also very easy to learn and most of the members of the Programming Club know it or can easily learn it. This also means that anyone editing just needs to know some JavaScript.

The files are linked in on the index.html page.

Thank you.
